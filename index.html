        <p class="mt-3">
          Almost everything we do in programming requires some kind of
          algorithm. Different problems, conditions, and/or requirements can
          make some algorithms more effective than others. Having some
          understanding of common problem solving patterns can help us see
          opportunities for more effectively solving problems and knowing which
          data structure and/or algorithm are best suited for the job.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some common problem solving patterns:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Frequency Counter</strong> - Some problems often require
            keeping track of the frequency of values in some collection of data
            (e.g. Arrays). Instead of using nested loops to count how many times
            a specific value occurs, the Frequency Counter pattern makes use of
            objects or sets to increment the frequency of specific values while
            passing through the collection only once.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Multiple Pointers</strong> - This pattern is especially
            useful when a collection of data is structured in predictable ways
            (e.g. when an array of numbers is already sorted). The Multiple
            Pointers pattern takes advantage of the predictable structure of the
            collection to more effectively iterate through the items by (as the
            name implies) creating multiple pointers at different positions,
            then moving to different positions through the collection (i.e.
            start/middle/end) until a certain condition is fulfilled or all
            items in the collection are visited.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sliding Window</strong> - Some types of problems may involve
            keeping track of a subset of data in a collection of items. The
            Sliding Window pattern is an effective way to keep track and/or
            manipulate subsets of data in a collection, by creating a "window"
            of a certain size (that may or may not get smaller or larger
            depending on certain conditions) using multiple pointers, then
            moving the "window" by moving the start and end pointers across the
            collection.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Divide and Conquer</strong> - This is another pattern that
            is especially useful for collections that have a predictable
            structure. Depending on the required conditions, one can
            tremendously reduce the time needed to iterate through the
            collection if the predictable structure of the items allows you to
            ignore unnecessary parts of the collection if they don't fulfill a
            certain condition.

          <strong>Recursion</strong> is a method of solving a computational
          problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances
          of the same problem. In programming, this means using functions that
          call themselves from within their own code. The approach can be
          applied to many types of problems, and recursion is one of the central
          ideas of computer science. Indeed, we're going to see recursion being
          used in several of the data structures and algorithms we'll be
          exploring later.

        </em>

        <p class="mt-3">
          Some problems may involve finding a specific value (or values) within
          a given collection of data (e.g. Arrays, strings, etc.) The simplest
          way to search for a specific value is to look at
          <em>every single item in the collection</em> and check if it is the
          item we want.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript has built-in methods for searching through such
          collections. For example, here are some useful array search methods:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >
              <code>indexOf()</code>

          <li>
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/includes"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >
              <code>includes()</code>
            </a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >
              <code>find()</code>
            </a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >
              <code>findIndex()</code>
            </a>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For many everyday use-cases, these built-in search methods can do
          their job well enough. However, for more complex problems, we may need
          to look at other, potentially more effective ways to search through a
          given collection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's look at some ways to search through a collection of elements:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Linear Search</strong> - This is the simplest way to search
            for an item. Linear Search iterates over the collection from start
            to end, checking every single item to see if they are what we are
            looking for.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Binary Search</strong> - Using the Divide and Conquer
            pattern, Binary Search takes advantage of a predictably structured
            collection. For example, when an array of integers is sorted in
            ascending order, we can safely ignore previous items if the number
            we're looking for is greater than the current item (or ignore all
            next items if the current item is less than what we're looking for).
            With Binary Search, we can start at the middle of the collection,
            and safely ignore one half of the remaining items depending on the
            condition, then repeat the same process for the remaining items
            until we find the item or we run out of items to check.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>There are also more clever ways to search through strings:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Naive String Search</strong> - Similar to Linear Search,
            Naive String Search simply iterates from start to end of the string
            to check if a given pattern is found.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) String Search</strong> - searches
            for occurrences of a "word" <code>W</code> within a main "text
            string" <code>S</code> by employing the observation that when a
            mismatch occurs, the word itself embodies sufficient information to
            determine where the next match could begin, thus bypassing
            re-examination of previously matched characters.
          </li>

        <p class="mt-3">
          Sorting is the process of rearranging iems in a collection such that
          the items are in some predictable order. There are many ways to sort a
          collection of items, for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sorting numbers from smallest to largest (or vice versa)</li>
          <li>Sorting strings in alphabetical order</li>
          <li>Sorting dates in chronoligical order</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here are some basic Sorting Algorithms:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Bubble Sort</strong> - Sometimes referred to as sinking
            sort, Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by
            repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong
            order. It works by having the largest values "bubble" up to the top
            (or smaller values to the bottom). This simple algorithm performs
            poorly in real world use and is used primarily as an educational
            tool to introduce the concept of a sorting algorithm.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Selection Sort</strong> - Sorts an array by repeatedly
            finding the smallest element (considering ascending order) from the
            unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm divides
            the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is
            built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list and a
            sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the
            list.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Insertion Sort</strong> - A simple sorting algorithm that
            builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. Much
            like Selection Sort, Insertion Sort also divides the input list into
            two parts (unsorted and sorted sublists). At each iteration,
            insertion sort removes one element from the unsorted input data,
            finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it
            there. It repeats until no unsorted input elements remain. Insertion
            Sort also works similar to the way people sort playing cards in
            their hands.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          With the power of recursion, one can also use clever tricks to more
          efficiently sort a collection of items:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Merge Sort</strong> - A divide and conquer algorithm that
            was invented by John von Neumann in 1945. It takes advantage of the
            fact that arrays of size 1 or 0 are always sorted. Merge Sort
            divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two
            halves until the array is divided into subarrays of size 1 or 0, and
            then merges the two sorted halves until one full sorted array
            remains. A <code>merge()</code> helper function is useful for
            repeatedly merging the split subarrays.

              <strong>Quicksort</strong> - A commonly used sorting algorithm
              developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959 and
              published in 1961. It is a Divide and Conquer algorithm that picks
              an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the
              picked pivot.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are many different versions of Quicksort that pick pivot in
              different ways:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Always pick first element as pivot.</li>
              <li>Pick median as pivot. (ideal)</li>
              <li>Always pick last element as pivot.</li>
              <li>Pick a random element as pivot.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Quicksort partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays,
              according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
              For this reason, it is sometimes called
              <em>partition-exchange sort</em>. The sub-arrays are then sorted
              recursively. This can be done in-place, requiring small additional
              amounts of memory to perform the sorting.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          There are also some niche sorting algorithms that may be more
          efficient for dealing with specific types of items:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Radix Sort</strong> - A non-comparative sorting algorithm.
            Unlike the previous sorting algorithms, it avoids comparison by
            creating and distributing elements into buckets according to their
            radix. For elements with more than one significant digit, this
            bucketing process is repeated for each digit, while preserving the
            ordering of the prior step, until all digits have been considered.
            For this reason, Radix Sort has also been called
            <em>Bucket Sort</em> and <em>Digital Sort</em>. Radix Sort is
            especially useful for sorting integers and short strings.

          A <strong>linked list</strong> is a linear collection of data elements
          whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory.
          Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure
          consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a
          sequence. In its most basic form, each node contains: data, and a
          reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence.
          This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements
          from any position in the sequence during iteration. More complex
          variants add additional links, allowing more efficient insertion or
          removal of nodes at arbitrary positions.

        <h3 class="mt-3">Stacks</h3>
        <p>
          A <strong>Stack</strong> is an abstract data type that serves as a
          collection of elements, with two main principal operations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>push()</code>, which adds an element to the collection, and
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>pop()</code>, which removes the most recently added element
            that was not yet removed.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <img
          class="img-fluid"
          src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Lifo_stack.png"
          alt="Simple representation of a stack runtime with push and pop operations."
        />
        <p>
          Considered as a linear data structure, or more abstractly a sequential
          collection, the <code>push()</code> and <code>pop()</code> operations
          occur only at one end of the structure, referred to as the top of the
          stack. The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its
          alternative name, <strong>LIFO (last in, first out)</strong>. The name
          "stack" for this type of structure comes from the analogy to a set of
          physical items stacked on top of each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          In JavaScript,
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >
            Arrays</a
          >
          already have the <code>push()</code> and <code>pop()</code> methods
          that are essential for implementing stacks, so you can just use those
          methods as-is, and you can easily create a new stack by simply
          creating a new Array and treating it as a Stack.
        </p>

        <h3>Queues</h3>
        <p>
          A <strong>Queue</strong> is a collection of entities that are
          maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of
          entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from
          the other end of the sequence. By convention, the end of the sequence
          at which elements are added is called the back, tail, or rear of the
          queue, and the end at which elements are removed is called the head or
          front of the queue.
        </p>
        <p>Similar to Stacks, Queues also have two main operations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The operation of adding an element to the rear of the queue is known
            as <code>enqueue()</code>, and
          </li>
          <li>
            The operation of removing an element from the front is known as
            <code>dequeue()</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <img
          class="img-fluid"
          src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Data_Queue.svg/1280px-Data_Queue.svg.png"
          alt="Representation of a FIFO (first in, first out) queue"
        />
        <p>
          A Queue is also called a
          <strong>first-in-first-out (FIFO)</strong> data structure. In a FIFO
          data structure, the first element added to the queue will be the first
          one to be removed. This is equivalent to the requirement that once a
          new element is added, all elements that were added before have to be
          removed before the new element can be removed. This is analogous to
          the words used when people line up to wait for goods or services.
        </p>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, Arrays already have the <code>push()</code> and
          <code>shift()</code> methods that are analogous to the
          <code>enqueue()</code> and <code>dequeue()</code> methods essential
          for implementing queues, so you can just use those methods as-is, and
          you can easily create a new queue by simply creating a new Array and
          treating it as a Queue.

        <p class="mt-3">
          A <strong>Binary Search Tree (BST)</strong> is a type of
          <em>Binary Tree</em>, whose internal nodes each store a value, and
          each has two distinguished sub-trees, commonly denoted left and right.
          A BST additionally satisfies the binary search property: The value in
          each node is greater than or equal to any value stored in the left
          sub-tree, and less than or equal to any value stored in the right
          sub-tree.
        </p>

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre>
          <code class="language-js">const bst = new BinarySearchTree();

bst
  .insert(50)
  .insert(30)
  .insert(20)

        </pre>

        <h3>Traversal/Searching Binary Search Trees</h3>
        <p>
          Binary Search Trees (and Binary Trees in general) can be traversed by
          visiting each node. There are two common ways for traversal:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p class="my-0">
              <strong>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</strong> - BFS starts at the
              tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to
              moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Extra memory,
              usually a queue, is needed to keep track of the child nodes that
              were encountered but not yet explored.
            </p>

            <pre class="my-0">
              <code class="language-js">bst.breadthFirstSearch() // should return [50, 30, 70, 20, 40, 60, 80]</code>

          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Depth First Search (DFS)</strong> - DFS starts at the root
              node and explores as far as possible along each branch before
              backtracking.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the case of Binary Trees, DFS can be ordered in one of three
              ways:
            </p>

            <ul>

                  current node first, and then traversing the left and right
                  sub-trees respectively. Pre-Order Traversal is topologically
                  sorted, because a parent node is processed before any of its
                  child nodes is done.

                  traversing the right sub-tree. For Binary Search Trees,

        <p class="mt-3">
          A <strong>Binary Heap</strong> is a heap data structure that takes the
          form of a binary tree. Binary heaps are a common way of implementing
          priority queues. The Binary Heap was introduced by J. W. J. Williams
          in 1964, as a data structure for Heapsort.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Binary Heap is defined as a Binary Tree with two additional
          constraints:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Shape property</strong>: A Binary Heap is a complete Binary
            Tree; that is, all levels of the tree, except possibly the last one
            (deepest) are fully filled, and, if the last level of the tree is
            not complete, the nodes of that level are filled from left to right.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Heap property</strong>: The value stored in each node is
            either greater than or equal to (max-heap) or less than or equal to
            (min-heap) the values in the node's children, according to some
            total order.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>Imagine a Binary Heap with the ff. elements:</p>
        <pre>
          <code class="language-js">heap
  .insert(41)
  .insert(39)
  .insert(33)
  .insert(18)
  .insert(27)
  .insert(12)
  .insert(55);</code>
        </pre>

        <p>As a Max Heap, the heap will be structured as follows:</p>
        <pre class="mermaid">
          graph TD
            55 --> 39
            55 --> 41
            39 --> 18
            39 --> 27
            41 --> 12
            41 --> 33
        </pre>

        <p>As a Min Heap, the heap will be structured as follows:</p>
        <pre class="mermaid">
          graph TD
            12 --> 27
            12 --> 18
            27 --> 41
            27 --> 33
            18 --> 39
            18 --> 55
        </pre>

        <h3>Heapsort</h3>
        <p>
          <em>Heapsort</em> is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. Heapsort
          can be thought of as an improved selection sort: like selection sort,
          heapsort divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and
          it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest
          element from it and inserting it into the sorted region. Unlike
          selection sort, heapsort does not waste time with a linear-time scan
          of the unsorted region; rather, heap sort maintains the unsorted
          region in a heap data structure to more quickly find the largest
          element in each step.
        </p>

          alt="An animation of Heapsort in action"
        />

        <p>
          The Heapsort algorithm involves preparing the list by first turning it
          into a max heap. The algorithm then repeatedly swaps the first value
          of the list with the last value, decreasing the range of values
          considered in the heap operation by one, and sifting the new first
          value into its position in the heap. This repeats until the range of
          considered values is one value in length.

          abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash
          table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash
          code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value
          can be found. During lookup, the key is hashed and the resulting hash
          indicates where the corresponding value is stored.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket,
          but most hash table designs employ an imperfect hash function, which
          might cause hash collisions where the hash function generates the same
          index for more than one key. Such collisions are typically
          accommodated in some way.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a well-dimensioned hash table, the average cost (number of
          instructions) for each lookup is independent of the number of elements
          stored in the table. Many hash table designs also allow arbitrary
          insertions and deletions of key–value pairs, at (amortized) constant
          average cost per operation.

        <em>

        </em>

        <p class="mt-3">
          A <strong>Graph</strong> is an abstract data type that is meant to
          implement the undirected graph and directed graph concepts from the
          field of graph theory within mathematics.
        </p>

        <p>
          A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set
          of <em>vertices</em> (also called nodes or points), together with a
          set of pairs connecting these vertices called <em>edges</em> (also
          called links or lines).
        </p>

        <p>
          Graphs are used to solve many real-life problems. Graphs are used to
          represent networks. The networks may include paths in a city or
          telephone network or circuit network. Graphs are also used in social
          networks where each person is represented with a vertex(or node). Each
          node is a structure and contains information like person id, name,
          gender, locale etc.
        </p>

        <h3>Representing a Graph</h3>
        <p>A graph can be represented in three ways:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Adjacency List</strong> - Vertices are stored as records or
            objects, and every vertex stores a list of adjacent vertices. This
            data structure allows the storage of additional data on the
            vertices. Additional data can be stored if edges are also stored as
            objects, in which case each vertex stores its incident edges and
            each edge stores its incident vertices.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Adjacency Matrix</strong> - A two-dimensional matrix, in
            which the rows represent source vertices and columns represent
            destination vertices. Data on edges and vertices must be stored
            externally. Only the cost for one edge can be stored between each
            pair of vertices.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Incidence Matrix</strong> - A two-dimensional matrix, in
            which the rows represent the vertices and columns represent the
            edges. The entries indicate the incidence relation between the
            vertex at a row and edge at a column.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <pre>
          <code class="language-js">const g = new Graph();
  
g.addVertex("A")
  .addVertex("B")
  .addVertex("C")
  .addVertex("D")
  .addVertex("E")
  .addVertex("F");

g.addEdge("A", "B")
  .addEdge("A", "C")
  .addEdge("B", "D")
  .addEdge("C", "E")
  .addEdge("D", "E")
  .addEdge("D", "F")
  .addEdge("E", "F");</code>
        </pre>
        <p>This creates the following graph:</p>
        <pre class="mermaid">
          graph LR
            A --- B
            A --- C
            B --- D
            C --- E
            D --- E
            E --- F
            D --- F
        </pre>

        <h3>Graph Traversal</h3>
        <p>
          Graph Traversal (also known as graph search) refers to the process of
          visiting (checking and/or updating) each vertex in a graph. Such
          traversals are classified by the order in which the vertices are
          visited. Tree traversal is a special case of graph traversal.
        </p>
        <p>Graphs can be traversed in different ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Depth-First Search (DFS)</strong> - DFS visits the child
            vertices before visiting the sibling vertices; that is, it traverses
            the depth of any particular path before exploring its breadth. A
            stack (often the program's call stack via recursion) is generally
            used when implementing the algorithm.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</strong> - BFS visits the sibling
            vertices before visiting the child vertices, and a queue is used in
            the search process. This algorithm is often used to find the
            shortest path from one vertex to another.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <h2>Dynamic Programming</h2>
        </header>

        <em>
          <a href="Dynamic Programming/index.html"> Live Demo (WIP) </a>
        </em>

        <p class="mt-3">
          <strong>Dynamic Programming</strong> is both a mathematical
          optimization method and a computer programming method. The method was
          developed by Richard Bellman in the 1950s and has found applications
          in numerous fields, from aerospace engineering to economics. It refers
          to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler
          sub-problems in a recursive manner. While some decision problems
          cannot be taken apart this way, decisions that span several points in
          time do often break apart recursively.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two key attributes that a problem must have in order for
          dynamic programming to be applicable:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Optimal Substructure</strong> - means that the solution to a
            given optimization problem can be obtained by the combination of
            optimal solutions to its sub-problems. Such optimal substructures
            are usually described by means of recursion. A problem is said to
            have optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed
            from optimal solutions of its subproblems. This property is used to
            determine the usefulness of dynamic programming and greedy
            algorithms for a problem.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Overlapping Subproblems</strong> - means that the space of
            sub-problems must be small, that is, any recursive algorithm solving
            the problem should solve the same sub-problems over and over, rather
            than generating new sub-problems. A problem is said to have
            overlapping subproblems if the problem can be broken down into
            subproblems which are reused several times or a recursive algorithm
            for the problem solves the same subproblem over and over rather than
            always generating new subproblems.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Example: Fibonacci</h3>
        <p>
          Consider our previous code for the Fibonacci series back in the
          <a href="#Recursion">Recursion</a>
          section:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="language-js">function fib(num){
  if(num <= 2) return 1;
  return fib(num - 1) + fib(num - 2);
}</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Even though the total number of sub-problems is actually small (only
          43 of them), we end up solving the same problems over and over if we
          adopt a naive recursive solution such as this:
        </p>
        <img
          class="img-fluid"
          src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kgXDS.png"
          alt="Illustration of how the recursive calls for the recursive Fibonacci solution grows over larger inputs"
        />
        <p class="mb-4">
          Dynamic programming takes account of this fact and solves each
          sub-problem only once. This can be achieved in either of two ways:
        </p>

        <h4>Memoization (Top-Down Approach)</h4>
        <p>
          This is the direct fall-out of the recursive formulation of any
          problem. If the solution to any problem can be formulated recursively
          using the solution to its sub-problems, and if its sub-problems are
          overlapping, then one can easily memoize or store the solutions to the
          sub-problems in a table. Whenever we attempt to solve a new
          sub-problem, we first check the table to see if it is already solved.
          If a solution has been recorded, we can use it directly, otherwise we
          solve the sub-problem and add its solution to the table.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="language-js">function memoizedFibHOF() {
  //  Create a cache variable to store previous results
  const cache = {};

  return function fib(num) {
    //  If the number we're looking for is already in the cache:
    if (num in cache) {
      //  Simply return the cached result
      return cache[num];
    }

    //  Otherwise, just calculate the result like usual
    if (num <= 2) {
      return num;
    }

    //  Don't forget to store new results in the cache!
    cache[num] = fib(num - 1) + fib(num - 2);
    return cache[num];
  };
}

const memoizedFib = memoizedFibHOF();</code>
        </pre>

        <h4>Tabulation (Bottom-Up Approach)</h4>
        <p>
          Once we formulate the solution to a problem recursively as in terms of
          its sub-problems, we can try reformulating the problem in a bottom-up
          fashion: try solving the sub-problems first and use their solutions to
          build-on and arrive at solutions to bigger sub-problems. This is also
          usually done in a tabular form by iteratively generating solutions to
          bigger and bigger sub-problems by using the solutions to small
          sub-problems. For example, if we already know the values of
          <code>fib(41)</code> and <code>fib(40)</code>, we can directly
          calculate the value of <code>fib(42)</code>:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="language-js">function tabulatedFibHOF() {
  //  Create a cache variable to store previous results
  const cache = [0, 1, 1];

  return function fib(num) {
    //  If the number we're looking for is already in the cache:
    if (num in cache) {
      //  Simply return the cached result
      return cache[num];
    }

    //  Otherwise, calculate next values
    //  based on previously cached results
    for (let i = cache.length; i < num; i++) {
      cache.push(cache[i - 1] + cache[i - 2]);
    }

    return cache[cache.length - 1];
  };
}

const tabulatedFib = tabulatedFibHOF();</code>

        <p class="mt-3">
          A <strong>Trie</strong>, also called <em>digital tree</em> or
          <em>prefix tree</em>, is a type of search tree, a tree data structure
          used for locating specific keys from within a set. These keys are most
          often strings, with links between nodes defined not by the entire key,
          but by individual characters. In order to access a key (to recover its
          value, change it, or remove it), the trie is traversed depth-first,
          following the links between nodes, which represent each character in
          the key.
        </p>
        <p>
          Common applications of tries include storing a predictive text or
          autocomplete dictionary and implementing approximate matching
          algorithms, such as those used in spell checking and hyphenation
          software. Such applications take advantage of a trie's ability to
          quickly search for, insert, and delete entries.

        <p class="mt-3">
          The simplest form of a <em>multidimensional array</em> is a
          <strong>2-dimensional array</strong>, also known as a <em>matrix</em>.
          A 2-dimensional array can be represented as an array where each
          element is also an array.
        </p>

          alt="Illustration of a 2-dimensional array with 3 rows and 3 columns"
        />

        <h3>Traversing 2D Arrays</h3>
        <p>
          Much like graphs, there are also other advanced algorithms to traverse
          through a 2-dimensional array, such as
          <em>Breadth-first Search</em> and <em>Depth-first Search</em>.
        </p>
        <p>Consider the following 2D Array:</p>
        <pre>
          <code class="language-js">const grid = [
  [1,  2,  3,  4,  5],
  [6,  7,  8,  9,  10],
  [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
  [16, 17, 18, 19, 20],
  [21, 22, 23, 24, 25],
];</code>
        </pre>

        <h4>Depth-first Search</h4>
        <p>
          Representing a 2-dimensional array as a grid, we can see that we have
          four directions to choose from to traverse to an adjacent element.
          With Depth-first Search, we prioritize going as far as possible in one
          direction before going another direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this example, we prioritize going
          <strong>up, right, down, left</strong>, in that order:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="language-js">depthFirstSearch2D(grid); // start from 1
// should return:
// [1,  2,  3,  4,  5,
//  10, 15, 20, 25, 24,
//  19, 14, 9,  8,  13,
//  18, 23, 22, 17, 12,
//  7,  6,  11, 16, 21]</code>
        </pre>

        <h4>Breadth-first Search</h4>
        <p>
          With Breadth-first Search, we prioritize visiting every element
          adjacent to the current item in one direction before going to another
          item. This means we are traversing outward in a ring-like pattern from
          the starting item.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this example, we prioritize going
          <strong>up, right, down, left</strong>, in that order:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="language-js">breadthFirstSearch2D(grid); // start from 1
// should return:
// [1,  2,  6,  3,  7,
//  11, 4,  8,  12, 16,
//  5,  9,  13, 17, 21,
//  10, 14, 18, 22, 15,
//  19, 23, 20, 24, 25]</code>
