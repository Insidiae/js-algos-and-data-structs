# Queues

A Queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence. By convention, the end of the sequence at which elements are added is called the back, tail, or rear of the queue, and the end at which elements are removed is called the head or front of the queue.

The operation of adding an element to the rear of the queue is known as enqueue, and the operation of removing an element from the front is known as dequeue. Other operations may also be allowed, often including a `peek()` or front operation that returns the value of the next element to be dequeued without dequeuing it.

A Queue is also called a first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structure. In a FIFO data structure, the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. This is equivalent to the requirement that once a new element is added, all elements that were added before have to be removed before the new element can be removed. This is analogous to the words used when people line up to wait for goods or services.

## Creating a Queue with an Array

The Array already has the `push()` and `shift()` methods that are analogous to the `enqueue()` and `dequeue()` methods essential for implementing queues, so you can just use those methods as-is, and you can easily create a new queue by simply creating a new Array and treating it as a Queue.

Example:

- `const arrQueue = []`

You can then use the `push()` method to add elements into the queue.

Examples:

- `arrQueue.push("Hello")`
- `arrQueue.push("there")`
- `arrQueue.push("General")`
- `arrQueue.push("Kenobi")`

And use the `shift()` method to remove elements from the queue.

Examples:

- `arrQueue.shift() // should return "Hello"`
- `arrQueue.shift() // should return "there"`
- `arrQueue.shift() // should return "General"`
- `arrQueue.shift() // should return "Kenobi"`

> **Note:** Using the `shift()` method is inefficient due to the array needing to re-index all subsequent items when another item is removed from the beginning.

> You can also use the `unshift()` and `pop()` methods instead, but `unshift()` still has the same re-indexing problem.

## Creating a Queue From Scratch

Alternatively, you can also create a Queue from scratch using ES6 classes. Queues are considered to be _abstract data types_, which means it has no single "correct" or concrete implementation to be followed, as long as its behavior or functionality remains the same to the user.

In this example, we create an implementation for a Queue by using a modified version of a Singly Linked List. This also allows us to name the `enqueue()` and `dequeue()` methods appropriately, and avoid the re-indexing problem that Arrays have when dealing with items at the beginning.

Example:

- `const listQueue = new Queue()`

You can then use the `unqueue()` and `dequeue()` methods to add or remove elemtns from the queue, respectively. We can also add a `peek()` method to the Queue that simply returns the value at the front of the queue without actually removing the item.

Examples:

- Adding items using `enqueue()`
  - `listQueue.enqueue("Hello")`
  - `listQueue.enqueue("there")`
  - `listQueue.enqueue("General")`
  - `listQueue.enqueue("Kenobi")`
- Viewing the top of the Queue using `peek()`
  - `listQueue.peek() // should return "Hello"`
- Removing items using `dequeue()`
  - `listQueue.dequeue() // should return "Hello"`
  - `listQueue.dequeue() // should return "there"`
  - `listQueue.dequeue() // should return "General"`
  - `listQueue.dequeue() // should return "Kenobi"`

```js
class ListNode {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

class Queue {
  constructor() {
    this.first = null;
    this.last = null;
    this.length = 0;
  }
  //* The enqueue method accepts a value to be added
  //* to the end of the list
  enqueue(value) {
    //  Create a new ListNode for the given value
    const newNode = new ListNode(value);
    //  If list is currently empty, point the first pointer to the new ListNode
    if (!this.first) this.first = newNode;
    //  otherwise, point the previous last ListNode's next pointer
    //  to the new ListNode
    else this.last.next = newNode;
    //  Point the last pointer to the new ListNode
    this.last = newNode;
    //  Increment the length property of the list
    this.length++;
  }
  //* The dequeue method removes the item from the first/start of the list
  //* It also returns the value of the removed item
  dequeue() {
    //  If list is empty, return undefined
    if (!this.first) return;
    //  Get the value on the current first ListNode
    const value = this.first.value;
    //  Set the new first pointer into the next ListNode
    this.first = this.first.next;
    //  Decrement length property of the list
    this.length--;
    //  If list is now empty, unset the last pointer
    if (!this.first) this.last = null;
    //  Return the value of the removed ListNode
    return value;
  }
  //* The peek method simply returns the first ListNode
  peek() {
    return this.first;
  }
  //* The toArray method converts the linked list into an array
  toArray() {
    //  Initialize an empty array
    const arr = [];
    //  Loop through the list, and push the values into the array
    for (let i = this.first; i !== null; i = i.next) arr.push(i.value);
    //  Return the array
    return arr;
  }
}
```
