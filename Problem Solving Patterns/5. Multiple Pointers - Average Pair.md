# Multiple Pointers - Average Pair

Write a function called `averagePair`. Given a sorted array of integers and a target average, determine if there is a pair of values in the array where the average of the pair equals the target average. There may be more than one pair that matches the average target.

Bonus Constraints:
* Time: O(N)
* Space: O(1)

Sample Input:
* `averagePair([1,2,3],2.5) // true`
* `averagePair([1,3,3,5,6,7,10,12,19],8) // true`
* `averagePair([-1,0,3,4,5,6], 4.1) // false`
* `averagePair([],4) // false`

### Solution:
```js
function averagePair(arr, avg){
  //  Create two pointers at the start/end of the array
  let p1 = 0;
  let p2 = arr.length - 1;
  //  Loop through the array using these pointers
  while(p1 < p2) {
    //  Take the average value of the two items referenced by the pointers
    const cur = (arr[p1] + arr[p2]) / 2;
    //* We are given a sorted array as input,
    //* so finding the target pair becomes much simpler
    //  If current average is same as targer average, we have found the target pair!
    if(cur === avg) return true;
    //  If current average is less than target average, move start pointer forward
    if(cur < avg) p1++;
    //  If current average is more than target average, move end pointer backward
    if(cur > avg) p2--;
  }
  //  If no target pair is found, return false
  return false;
}
