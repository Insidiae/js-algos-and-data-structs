# Multiple Pointers - Is Subsequence

Write a function called `isSubsequence` which takes in two strings and checks whether the characters in the first string form a subsequence of the characters in the second string. In other words, the function should check whether the characters in the first string appear somewhere in the second string, **without their order changing**.

Examples:
* `isSubsequence('hello', 'hello world'); // true`
* `isSubsequence('sing', 'sting'); // true`
* `isSubsequence('abc', 'abracadabra'); // true`
* `isSubsequence('abc', 'acb'); // false (order matters)`

Your solution MUST have AT LEAST the following complexities:
* Time Complexity - O(N + M)
* Space Complexity - O(1)

### Solution
```js
function isSubsequence(str1, str2) {
  //  Create a pointer for the first string
  let p1 = 0;
  //  Loop through the 2nd string
  for(let char of str2) {
    //  If current char at 2nd string matches current char at 1st string,
    //  increment 1st pointer
    if(char === str1[p1]) p1++;
    //  If 1st pointer has now looped through the 1st string, return true
    if(p1 === str1.length) return true;
  }
  //  If 2nd string has now finished looping without matching everything
  //  in the first string, return false
  return false;
}
```
