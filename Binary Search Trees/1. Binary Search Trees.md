# Binary Search Trees

## Binary Trees

A Binary Tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. Binary trees can be used in two very different ways:

- First, as a means of accessing nodes based on some value or label associated with each node. Binary trees labelled this way are used to implement **_Binary Search Trees_** and _Binary Heaps_, and are used for efficient searching and sorting. The designation of non-root nodes as left or right child even when there is only one child present matters in some of these applications, in particular, it is significant in binary search trees. However, the arrangement of particular nodes into the tree is not part of the conceptual information. For example, in a normal binary search tree the placement of nodes depends almost entirely on the order in which they were added, and can be re-arranged (for example by balancing) without changing the meaning.

- Second, as a representation of data with a relevant bifurcating structure. In such cases, the particular arrangement of nodes under and/or to the left or right of other nodes is part of the information (that is, changing it would change the meaning). Common examples occur with Huffman coding and cladograms. The everyday division of documents into chapters, sections, paragraphs, and so on is an analogous example with n-ary rather than binary trees.

## Binary Search Trees

A Binary Search Tree is a type of Binary Tree, whose internal nodes each store a value, and each has two distinguished sub-trees, commonly denoted left and right. The tree additionally satisfies the binary search property: the value in each node is greater than or equal to any value stored in the left sub-tree, and less than or equal to any value stored in the right sub-tree.

![A binary search tree of size 9 and depth 3, with 8 at the root. The leaves are not drawn.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Binary_search_tree.svg/1024px-Binary_search_tree.svg.png)

A Binary Search Tree has the following average time complexity for the ff. operations:

- **Access** - O(log(n))
- **Search** - O(log(n))
- **Insertion** - O(log(n))
- **Deletion** - O(log(n))

The shape of the Binary Search Tree depends entirely on the order of insertions and deletions and can become degenerate. A degenerate Binary Search Tree has all nodes having exactly one child at most, and thus behaves like a Linked List having a worst-case time complexity of **O(n)**.

## Operations

### Creating the `BinarySearchTree` and `BSTNode` Classes

```js
class BSTNode {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.left = null;
    this.right = null;
  }
}
```

```js
class BinarySearchTree {
  constructor() {
    this.root = null;
  }
}
```

### Insertion

Insertion begins as a search would begin; if the key is not equal to that of the root, we search the left or right subtrees as before. Eventually, we will reach an external node and add the new node as its right or left child, depending on the node's value. In other words, we examine the root and recursively insert the new node to the left subtree if its value is less than that of the root, or the right subtree if its value is greater than or equal to the root.

**Examples**

- ```js
  bst
    .insert(50)
    .insert(30)
    .insert(20)
    .insert(40)
    .insert(70)
    .insert(60)
    .insert(80);
  ```

```js
//* The insert method takes a value and adds it
//* into its proper place in the Binary Search Tree
insert(val, currentNode = this.root) {
  //  Starting at the root:
  if (!this.root) {
    //  If there is no root, make the new node the root
    this.root = new BSTNode(val);
  }
  //  Otherwise:
  //  If the new node has a value greater
  //  than the current node:
  else if (val > currentNode.value) {
    //  If there is no right node,
    //  add the new node to the right
    if (!currentNode.right) {
      currentNode.right = new BSTNode(val);
    }
    //  Otherwise, move to the right node and repeat
    else {
      this.insert(val, currentNode.right);
    }
  }
  //  If the new node has a value less
  //  than the current node:
  else if (val < currentNode.value) {
    //  If there is no left node,
    //  add the new node to the left
    if (!currentNode.left) {
      currentNode.left = new BSTNode(val);
    }
    //  Otherwise, move to the left node and repeat
    else {
      this.insert(val, currentNode.left);
    }
  }

  //* Optionally return the BST
  //* to chain other method calls
  return this;
}
```

### Searching/Access

We begin by examining the root node. If the tree is null, the value we are searching for does not exist in the tree. Otherwise, if the value equals that of the root, the search is successful and we return the node. If the value is less than that of the root, we search the left subtree. Similarly, if the value is greater than that of the root, we search the right subtree. This process is repeated until the value is found or the remaining subtree is null. If the searched value is not found after a null subtree is reached, then the value is not present in the tree. This is easily expressed as a recursive algorithm.

**Example**

- `bst.find(30) // should return the node with the value of 30`

```js
//* The find method accepts a value
//* and returns the node with the matching value, if any
find(val, currentNode = this.root) {
  //  Check the current node (default is root):
  if (!currentNode) {
    //  If there is no value, return undefined
    return;
  }
  //  Otherwise:
  //  If the value we're looking for is equal to
  //  the value of the current node, return the node
  if (val === currentNode.value) {
    return currentNode;
  }
  //  Otherwise:
  //  If the value we're looking for is less than
  //  the value of the current node:
  else if (val < currentNode.value) {
    //  Move to the left, and repeat
    return this.find(val, currentNode.left);
  }
  //  If the value we're looking for is greater than
  //  the value of the current node:
  else {
    //  Move to the right, and repeat
    return this.find(val, currentNode.right);
  }
}
```

### Deletion

When removing a node from a binary search tree it is mandatory to maintain the inorder sequence of the nodes. There are many possibilities to do this. However, the following method which has been proposed by T. Hibbard in 1962 guarantees that the heights of the subject subtrees are changed by at most one. There are three possible cases to consider:

- **Deleting a node with no children**: simply remove the node from the tree.
- **Deleting a node with one child**: remove the node and replace it with its child.
- **Deleting a node with two children**: As illustrated in the figure below, choose either node D's _inorder predecessor_ C or _inorder successor_ E (see figure). Instead of deleting D, overwrite its value with E's. If E does not have a child, remove E from its previous parent G. If E has a child F, it is a right child, so that it is to replace E at E's parent.

![Deleting a node with two children from a binary search tree.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/AVL-tree-delete.svg/1280px-AVL-tree-delete.svg.png)

In all cases, when D happens to be the root, make the replacement node root again.

Nodes with two children are harder to delete. A node's _inorder successor_ is its right subtree's left-most child, and a node's _inorder predecessor_ is the left subtree's right-most child. In either case, this node will have only one or no child at all. Delete it according to one of the two simpler cases above.

A helper method can be created to help get a node's inorder successor:

```js
//* This helper method takes a node
//* and finds its inorder successor
//? The inorder successor is the smallest node
//? from the current node's right subtree
findInorderSuccessor(currentNode) {
  let min = currentNode.value;
  while (currentNode.left !== null) {
    min = currentNode.left.value;
    currentNode = currentNode.left;
  }
  return min;
}
```

**Examples**

- Deleting a node with no children
  - `bst.remove(20) // removes the node with the value of 20`
- Deleting a node with one child
  - `bst.remove(30) // removes the node with the value of 30`
- Deleting a node with two children
  - `bst.remove(50) // removes the node with the value of 50`

```js
//* The remove method accepts a value,
//* removes it from the tree,
//* and re-arranges the remaining nodes
//* to maintain the integrity of the Binary Search Tree
remove(val, currentNode = this.root, parentNode = this, direction = "root") {
  //  Return false if the tree is empty
  //  or if the value is not found
  if (!currentNode) {
    return false;
  }

  //  If value to be deleted is less than the
  //  current node's value, move to the left
  if (val < currentNode.value) {
    return this.remove(val, currentNode.left, currentNode, "left");
  }
  //  If value to be deleted is greater than the
  //  current node's value, move to the right
  else if (val > currentNode.value) {
    return this.remove(val, currentNode.right, currentNode, "right");
  }
  //  Otherwise, remove the current node:
  else {
    //  If the current node has no children,
    //  simply remove the node
    if (!currentNode.left && !currentNode.right) {
      parentNode[direction] = null;
      return true;
    }
    //  If the current node has one child,
    //  move the child into the current node's position
    if (!currentNode.left) {
      parentNode[direction] = currentNode.right;
      return true;
    }

    if (!currentNode.right) {
      parentNode[direction] = currentNode.left;
      return true;
    }

    //  If the current node has two children,
    //  Set the current node's value to its
    //  inorder successor's value...
    currentNode.value = this.findInorderSuccessor(currentNode.right);
    //  ...and then remove the inorder successor
    //  from its old position
    return this.remove(currentNode.value, currentNode.right, currentNode);
  }
}
```

## Traversal/Searching

- ```js
  bst2
    .insert(50)
    .insert(30)
    .insert(20)
    .insert(40)
    .insert(70)
    .insert(60)
    .insert(80);
  ```

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-First Search starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Extra memory, usually a queue, is needed to keep track of the child nodes that were encountered but not yet explored.

**Example**

- `bst2.breadthFirstSearch() // should return [50, 30, 70, 20, 40, 60, 80]`

```js
breadthFirstSearch() {
  //  Create a queue for the nodes to be visited
  const visited = [this.root];
  //  Initialize an array to store the values
  const values = [];

  //  Using recursion, iterate over the tree:
  function traverseBreadthFirst() {
    //  Dequeue a value from the queue
    //  to get the current node
    const currentNode = visited.shift();
    //  Add the current node's left and right children,
    //  if any, to the queue
    if (currentNode.left) visited.push(currentNode.left);
    if (currentNode.right) visited.push(currentNode.right);
    //  Add the current node's value into the values array
    values.push(currentNode.value);

    //  If there are still nodes in the queue, keep going
    if (visited.length) traverseBreadthFirst();
  }

  //  Invoke the recursive function
  traverseBreadthFirst();
  //  Return the values array
  return values;
}
```

Notice we used a helper function to recursively traverse the tree. The same process can be done with a purely recursive function:

```js
breadthFirstSearch(visited = [this.root], values = []) {
  //  If the queue is empty, return the values array
  if (!visited.length) return values;

  //  Dequeue a value from the queue
  //  to get the current node
  const currentNode = visited.shift();
  //  Add the current node's left and right children,
  //  if any, to the queue
  if (currentNode.left) visited.push(currentNode.left);
  if (currentNode.right) visited.push(currentNode.right);
  //  Add the current node's value into the values array
  values.push(currentNode.value);
  //  Make a recursive call to keep going
  return this.breadthFirstSearch(visited, values);
}
```

### Depth First Search (DFS) - Pre-Order Traversal

In contrast to Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search The algorithm starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

In the case of Binary Trees, DFS can be ordered in one of three ways:

- **Pre-Order Traversal** - Accesses/visits the current node first, and then traversing the left and right sub-trees respectively. Pre-Order Traversal is topologically sorted, because a parent node is processed before any of its child nodes is done.
- **In-Order Traversal** - Traverses the left sub-tree first, then accesses the current node before finally traversing the right sub-tree. For Binary Search Trees, In-Order Traversal retrieves the values in ascending sorted order.
- **Post-Order Traversal** - Traverses the left and right sub-trees first before finally accessing the current node.

For the Pre-Order Traversal, the Binary Search Tree is traversed with the following steps:

1. Access the data part of the current node.
2. Traverse the left subtree by recursively calling the pre-order function.
3. Traverse the right subtree by recursively calling the pre-order function.

**Example**

- `bst2.DFSPreOrder() // should return [50, 30, 20, 40, 70, 60, 80]`

```js
DFSPreOrder() {
  //  Create an array to store the values
  const values = [];

  //  Using recursion, iterate over the tree
  function traversePreOrder(currentNode) {
    //  Add the current node's value into the values array
    values.push(currentNode.value);
    //  Make a recursive call for the left node, if any
    if (currentNode.left) traversePreOrder(currentNode.left);
    //  Make a recursive call for the right node, if any
    if (currentNode.right) traversePreOrder(currentNode.right);
  }

  //  Invoke the recursive function
  traversePreOrder(this.root);
  //  Return the values array
  return values;
}
```

### Depth First Search (DFS) - In-Order Traversal

1. Traverse the left subtree by recursively calling the in-order function.
2. Access the data part of the current node.
3. Traverse the right subtree by recursively calling the in-order function.

**Example**

- `bst2.DFSInOrder() // should return [20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]`

```js
DFSInOrder() {
  //  Create an array to store the values
  const values = [];

  //  Using recursion, iterate over the tree
  function traverseInOrder(currentNode) {
    //  Make a recursive call for the left node, if any
    if (currentNode.left) traverseInOrder(currentNode.left);
    //  Add the current node's value into the values array
    values.push(currentNode.value);
    //  Make a recursive call for the right node, if any
    if (currentNode.right) traverseInOrder(currentNode.right);
  }

  //  Invoke the recursive function
  traverseInOrder(this.root);
  //  Return the values array
  return values;
}
```

### Depth First Search (DFS) - Post-Order Traversal

1. Traverse the left subtree by recursively calling the post-order function.
2. Traverse the right subtree by recursively calling the post-order function.
3. Access the data part of the current node.

**Example**

- `bst2.DFSPostOrder() // should return [20, 40, 30, 60, 80, 70, 50]`

```js
DFSPostOrder() {
  //  Create an array to store the values
  const values = [];

  //  Using recursion, iterate over the tree
  function traversePostOrder(currentNode) {
    //  Make a recursive call for the left node, if any
    if (currentNode.left) traversePostOrder(currentNode.left);
    //  Make a recursive call for the right node, if any
    if (currentNode.right) traversePostOrder(currentNode.right);
    //  Add the current node's value into the values array
    values.push(currentNode.value);
  }

  //  Invoke the recursive function
  traversePostOrder(this.root);
  //  Return the values array
  return values;
}
```

## Interview Questions Regarding Binary Search Trees

### Check if BST is balanced

A BST is considered "balanced" if the depth of all nodes with one child or less, differ by no more than one.

```js
isBalanced() {
  //  Using recursion, traverse every node
  //  to check if the three is balanced
  //* The recursive function returns an array
  //* containing a bool for if the node is balanced,
  //* and a number for the height of the node
  function checkBalanced(currentNode) {
    //  If current node is empty, it is balanced
    //  and has a height of -1
    if (!currentNode) {
      return [true, -1];
    }
    //  Otherwise:
    //  Make a recursive call for the left subtree
    const [leftIsBalanced, leftHeight] = checkBalanced(currentNode.left);
    //  If the left subtree is NOT balanced:
    if (!leftIsBalanced) {
      //  Return false for the bool value
      return [false, leftHeight];
    }
    //  Make a recursive call for the right subtree
    const [rightIsBalanced, rightHeight] = checkBalanced(currentNode.right);
    //  If the right subtree is NOT balanced:
    if (!rightIsBalanced) {
      //  Return false for the bool value
      return [false, rightHeight];
    }
    //  Otherwise, it means both subtrees are balanced
    //  Now compare the height of each subtree
    //  The current node is only balanced if the
    //  absolute difference of the height of both subtrees
    //  are less than or equal to 1
    const subtreesAreBalanced = Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) <= 1;
    //  To calculate the height of the current node,
    //  simply add 1 to the height of the larger subtree
    const currentHeight = Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
    //  Return the balanced status of the node
    //  and the height of the current node
    return [subtreesAreBalanced, currentHeight];
  }

  //  Invoke the recursive function starting from
  //  the root, and return the bool value
  return checkBalanced(this.root)[0];
}
```

### Validate a Binary Search Tree

Given a Binary Tree, write a function that checks whether the tree matches the criteria of being a valid Binary Search Tree.

```js
isValidBST() {
  //  Create a variable to store the previous value
  let prev = -Infinity;
  //  Create a variable to keep track of the BST's validity
  let isValid = true;

  //  Using recursion, iterate over the tree
  function traverseValidate(currentNode) {
    //  Make a recursive call for the left node, if any
    if (currentNode.left) traverseValidate(currentNode.left);
    //  If current node's value is greater than the previous value:
    if (currentNode.value > prev) {
      //  Set the new previous value to be the current node's value
      prev = currentNode.value;
    } else {
      //  Otherwise, the tree is NOT valid
      isValid = false;
      //  Also make sure we don't make any more
      //  unnecessary recursive calls
      return;
    }
    //  If the BST is still valid:
    //  Make a recursive call for the right node, if any
    if (isValid && currentNode.right) traverseValidate(currentNode.right);
  }

  //  Invoke the recursive function
  traverseValidate(this.root);
  //  Return the variable we were using to check for validity
  return isValid;
}
```
