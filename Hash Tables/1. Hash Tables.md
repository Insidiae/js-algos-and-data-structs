# Hash Tables

A **Hash Table** is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. During lookup, the key is hashed and the resulting hash indicates where the corresponding value is stored.

Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ an imperfect hash function, which might cause hash collisions where the hash function generates the same index for more than one key. Such collisions are typically accommodated in some way.

In a well-dimensioned hash table, the average cost (number of instructions) for each lookup is independent of the number of elements stored in the table. Many hash table designs also allow arbitrary insertions and deletions of keyâ€“value pairs, at (amortized) constant average cost per operation.

Hash tables already exist by default in JavaScript in the form of **_Objects_** or **_Maps_**. However, we can also try implementing our own Hash Table from scratch!

## Implementing a Hash Table From Scratch

**Example:**

- `const hashTable = new HashTable(50);`

```js
class HashTable {
  constructor(size = 53) {
    this.keyMap = new Array(size);
  }
}
```

### A Simple Hash Function

The idea of hashing is to distribute the entries (key/value pairs) across an array of buckets. Given a key, the algorithm computes an index that suggests where the entry can be found.

Cryptographic hash functions are believed to provide good hash functions for any table size, either by modulo reduction or by bit masking. They may also be appropriate if there is a risk of malicious users trying to sabotage a network service by submitting requests designed to generate a large number of collisions in the server's hash tables. However, the risk of sabotage can also be avoided by cheaper methods (such as applying a secret salt to the data, or using a universal hash function).

For the purposes of this section, a simple hash function is already provided:

```js
//* A simple hash function that generates a hash index
//* from a given (lowercase) string
_hash(key) {
  //  Initialize a variable for the hash index
  let total = 0;
  //  Use some weird prime number to help make the hash index unique
  const WEIRD_PRIME = 6869;

  //  Loop over the key string
  //? Make sure the hash function is O(1) by limiting
  //? the number of iterations of the loop
  for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(key.length, 100); i++) {
    //  Get the current character and its ASCII keycode
    const char = key[i];
    const value = char.charCodeAt(0) - 96;

    //  Use the keycode value and the weird prime number
    //  to scramble the index value
    //? Make sure the index is within the bounds
    //? of the hash table's size
    total = (total * WEIRD_PRIME + value) % this.keyMap.length;
  }

  //  Return the final index value
  return total;
}
```

### Handling Collisions

Hash collisions are practically unavoidable when hashing a random subset of a large set of possible keys. For example, if 2,450 keys are hashed into a million buckets, even with a perfectly uniform random distribution, according to the birthday problem there is approximately a 95% chance of at least two of the keys being hashed to the same slot.

Therefore, almost all hash table implementations have some collision resolution strategy to handle such events. Some common strategies are described below. All these methods require that the keys (or pointers to them) be stored in the table, together with the associated values.

For this section, hash collisions will be handled through **Separate chaining**, where each bucket is independent, and has some sort of list of entries with the same index. The time for hash table operations is the time to find the bucket (which is constant) plus the time for the list operation.

### Set

**Example:**

- ```js
  hashTable
    .set("darkblue", "#00008b")
    .set("dupeblue", "#00008b")
    .set("salmon", "#fa8072")
    .set("lightcoral", "#f08080");
  ```

```js
//* The set methods accepts a key string and a value
//* and stores the key/value pair into the hash table
//* via hashing the key
set(key, value) {
  //  Hash the key using the hash function
  const hashIdx = this._hash(key);

  //  Store the value using the resulting hash index
  //! Use separate chaining to handle collisions
  //? This just means we store an array of key/value pairs
  //? with the given hash index
  //  If there are no items with the given hash index:
  if (!this.keyMap[hashIdx]) {
    //  Create an array then store the key/value pair
    this.keyMap[hashIdx] = [];
  }
  //  If the key already exists:
  let isDuplicateKey = false;
  for (let entry of this.keyMap[hashIdx]) {
    if (entry[0] === key) {
      //  replace its current value with the given value
      isDuplicateKey = true;
      entry[1] = value;
      break;
    }
  }
  //  Otherwise, simply push the key/value pair to the array
  if (!isDuplicateKey) {
    this.keyMap[hashIdx].push([key, value]);
  }

  //  Optionally return the hash table itself for easy chaining
  return this;
}
```

### Get

**Example:**

- `hashTable.get("darkblue") // should return "#00008b"`

```js
//* The get method accepts a key string
//* and returns the value corresponding to the key
get(key) {
  //  Hash the key using the hash function
  const hashIdx = this._hash(key);

  //  Loop over the array of key/value pairs
  if (this.keyMap[hashIdx]) {
    //  Get the value of the item with the corresponding key
    for (let item of this.keyMap[hashIdx]) {
      if (item[0] === key) {
        //  Return the value, if any
        return item[1];
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Keys

**Example:**

- `hashTable.keys() // should return ["darkblue", "dupeblue", "salmon", "lightcoral"]`

```js
//* The keys method simply returns an array of
//* all the keys stored within the hash table
//? This is functionally similar to Object.keys()
keys() {
  //  Initialize an array to store all keys
  const res = [];

  //  Loop over the key map
  for (let entryList of this.keyMap) {
    //  Push all keys (if any) into the array
    if (entryList) {
      for (let entry of entryList) {
        res.push(entry[0]);
      }
    }
  }

  //  Return the array
  return res;
}
```

### Values

**Example:**

- `hashTable.values() // should return ["#00008b", "#00008b", "#fa8072", "#f08080"]`

```js
//* The values method simply returns an array of
//* all the values stored within the hash table
//? This is functionally similar to Object.values()
values() {
  //  Initialize an array to store all values
  const res = [];

  //  Loop over the key map
  for (let entryList of this.keyMap) {
    //  Push all values (if any) into the array
    if (entryList) {
      for (let entry of entryList) {
        //? Optionally, you can filter out duplicate values
        //? from the result array
        // if (!res.includes(entry[1]))
        res.push(entry[1]);
      }
    }
  }

  //  Return the array
  return res;
}
```

### Entries

**Example:**

- `hashTable.entires() // should return [["darkblue", "#00008b"], ["dupeblue", "#00008b"], ["salmon", "#fa8072"], ["lightcoral", "#f08080"]]`

```js
//* The entries method simply returns an array of
//* all the key/value pairs stored within the hash table
//? This is functionally similar to Object.entries()
entries() {
  //  Initialize an array to store all entries
  const res = [];

  //  Loop over the key map
  for (let entryList of this.keyMap) {
    //  Push all entries (if any) into the array
    if (entryList) {
      for (let entry of entryList) {
        res.push(entry);
      }
    }
  }

  //  Return the array
  return res;
}
```
