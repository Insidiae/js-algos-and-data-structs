# [Question #25. Network Delay Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/network-delay-time/)

You are given a network of `n` nodes, labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given times, a list of travel times as directed edges <code>times[i] = (u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i</sub>)</code>, where <code>u<sub>i</sub></code> is the source node, <code>v<sub>i</sub></code> is the target node, and <code>w<sub>i</sub></code> is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

We will send a signal from a given node `k`. Return the time it takes for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the n nodes to receive the signal, return `-1`.

## Examples

- `networkDelayTime([[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], 4, 2) // should return 2`

  > **Explanation:** The graph structure of the network is shown:

- `networkDelayTime([[1,2,1]], 2, 1) // should return 1`
- `networkDelayTime([[1,2,1]], 2, 2) // should return -1`

## Solution

### Using [Dijkstra's Algorithm](../Graphs/2.%20Dijkstra%20Algorithm.md)

- Time Complexity: **O(E \* log(V))**, where `E` is the number of edges in the network, and `V` is the number of vertices in the network
- Space Complexity: **O(E + V)**

> **Note:** This solution also uses the [Priority Queue](../Binary%20Heaps/2.%20Priority%20Queues.md) code for implementing Dijkstra's algorithm.

```js
/**
 * @param {number[][]} times
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
function networkDelayTime(times, n, k) {
  //  Use an adjacency list to represent the network
  const adjacencyList = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
  for (let [source, target, weight] of times) {
    //? Since vertices are labeled from 1 to n,
    //? we need to account for that offset
    adjacencyList[source - 1].push([target - 1, weight]);
  }
  //  Create an array to store the shortest
  //  distances from the start vertex
  //? Starting vertex has an initial distance of 0,
  //? the rest have a starting distance of Infinity
  const distances = new Array(n).fill(Infinity);
  distances[k - 1] = 0;

  //  Create a priority queue to help traverse the graph
  const pq = new PriorityQueue();
  pq.enqueue(k - 1, distances[k - 1]);

  //  Loop through the priority queue
  while (pq.values.length) {
    //  Dequeue the next vertex from the queue
    const currentVertex = pq.dequeue().value;

    // Loop through the neighbors of that vertex
    for (let [neighbor, weight] of adjacencyList[currentVertex]) {
      //  Calculate the distance to the neighbor
      //  from the starting vertex
      const distance = distances[currentVertex] + weight;
      //  If the distance is less than what is
      //  currently stored in the distances object:
      if (distances[neighbor] > distance) {
        //  Update the distances object with the lower distance
        distances[neighbor] = distance;

        //  Enqueue the vertex with the total distance
        //  from the start node
        pq.enqueue(neighbor, distance);
      }
    }
  }

  //  Get the largest distance from the start vertex
  const ans = Math.max(...distances);
  //! If the largest distance is Infinity,
  //! it means there were unreachable vertices
  return ans < Infinity ? ans : -1;
}
```
