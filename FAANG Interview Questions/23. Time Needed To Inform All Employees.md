# [Question #23. Time Needed to Inform All Employees](https://leetcode.com/problems/time-needed-to-inform-all-employees/)

A company has `n` employees with a unique ID for each employee from `0` to `n - 1`. The head of the company is the one with `headID`.

Each employee has one direct manager given in the manager array where `manager[i]` is the direct manager of the `i-th` employee, `manager[headID] = -1`. Also, it is guaranteed that the subordination relationships have a tree structure.

The head of the company wants to inform all the company employees of an urgent piece of news. He will inform his direct subordinates, and they will inform their subordinates, and so on until all employees know about the urgent news.

The `i-th` employee needs `informTime[i]` minutes to inform all of his direct subordinates (i.e., After `informTime[i]` minutes, all his direct subordinates can start spreading the news).

Return _the number of minutes_ needed to inform all the employees about the urgent news.

## Examples

- `numOfMinutes(1, 0, [-1], [0]) // should return 0`

  > **Explanation:** The head of the company is the only employee in the company.

- `numOfMinutes(6, 2, [2,2,-1,2,2,2], [0,0,1,0,0,0]) // should return 1`

  > **Explanation:** The head of the company with id = 2 is the direct manager of all the employees in the company and needs 1 minute to inform them all.
  >
  > The tree structure of the employees in the company is shown:

- `numOfMinutes(7, 6, [1,2,3,4,5,6,-1], [0,6,5,4,3,2,1]) // should return 21`

  > **Explanation:** The head has id = 6. He will inform employee with id = 5 in 1 minute.
  >
  > The employee with id = 5 will inform the employee with id = 4 in 2 minutes.
  >
  > The employee with id = 4 will inform the employee with id = 3 in 3 minutes.
  >
  > The employee with id = 3 will inform the employee with id = 2 in 4 minutes.
  >
  > The employee with id = 2 will inform the employee with id = 1 in 5 minutes.
  >
  > The employee with id = 1 will inform the employee with id = 0 in 6 minutes.
  >
  > Needed time = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21.
  >

- ```js
  numOfMinutes(
    15,
    0,
    [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ); // should return 3
  ```

  > **Explanation:** The first minute the head will inform employees 1 and 2.
  >
  > The second minute they will inform employees 3, 4, 5 and 6.
  >
  > The third minute they will inform the rest of employees.

- `numOfMinutes(4, 2, [3,3,-1,2], [0,0,162,914]) // should return 1076`

## Solution

- Time Complexity: **O(N)**
- Space Complexity: **O(N)**

```js
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number} headID
 * @param {number[]} manager
 * @param {number[]} informTime
 * @return {number}
 */
function numOfMinutes(n, headID, manager, informTime) {
  //  Use an adjacency list to represent the tree structure
  const adjacencyList = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (manager[i] >= 0) {
      adjacencyList[manager[i]].push(i);
    }
  }

  /**
   * Traverse through the adjacency list using DFS.
   * @param {number} currentIdx
   * @return {number}
   */
  function traverseDepthFirst(currentIdx) {
    //  Keep track of the max time it takes to inform
    let maxTime = 0;
    //  Loop over the adjacent vertices
    for (let nextIdx of adjacencyList[currentIdx]) {
      //  Make a recursive call for each adjacent vertex,
      //  and store the max time it took to inform
      maxTime = Math.max(maxTime, traverseDepthFirst(nextIdx));
    }
    //  Add own inform time before and return
    return maxTime + informTime[currentIdx];
  }

  //  Return the result of DFS
  return traverseDepthFirst(headID);
}
```
