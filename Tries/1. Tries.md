# Trie

A **Trie**, also called **digital tree** or **prefix tree**, is a type of search tree, a tree data structure used for locating specific keys from within a set. These keys are most often strings, with links between nodes defined not by the entire key, but by individual characters. In order to access a key (to recover its value, change it, or remove it), the trie is traversed depth-first, following the links between nodes, which represent each character in the key.

Unlike a binary search tree, nodes in the trie do not store their associated key. Instead, a node's position in the trie defines the key with which it is associated. This distributes the value of each key across the data structure, and means that not every node necessarily has an associated value.

All the children of a node have a common prefix of the string associated with that parent node, and the root is associated with the empty string. This task of storing data accessible by its prefix can be accomplished in a memory-optimized way by employing a radix tree.

Though tries can be keyed by character strings, they need not be. The same algorithms can be adapted for ordered lists of any underlying type, e.g. permutations of digits or shapes. In particular, a bitwise trie is keyed on the individual bits making up a piece of fixed-length binary data, such as an integer or memory address.

Common applications of tries include storing a predictive text or autocomplete dictionary and implementing approximate matching algorithms, such as those used in spell checking and hyphenation software. Such applications take advantage of a trie's ability to quickly search for, insert, and delete entries. However, if storing dictionary words is all that is required (i.e. there is no need to store metadata associated with each word), a minimal deterministic acyclic finite state automaton (DAFSA) or radix tree would use less storage space than a trie. This is because DAFSAs and radix trees can compress identical branches from the trie which correspond to the same suffixes (or parts) of different words being stored.

## Operations

### Creating the `Trie` class

The trie is a tree of nodes which supports Find (`findWord()`) and Insert (`addWord()`) operations. `findWord()` returns the value for a key string, and `addWord()` inserts a string (the key) and a value into the trie. Both `addWord()` and `addWord()` run in **_O(m)_** time, where _m_ is the length of the key.

**Example:**

- `const t = new Trie();`

```js
class Trie {
  constructor() {
    this.characters = {};
    this.isWord = false;
  }
}
```

### Add Word

**Example:**

- ```js
  t.addWord("fun")
    .addWord("fast")
    .addWord("fat")
    .addWord("fate")
    .addWord("father")
    .addWord("forget")
    .addWord("awesome")
    .addWord("argue");
  ```

```js
addWord(word, index = 0) {
  //  If current index is equal to word length:
  if (index === word.length) {
    //  Set the current node to be a word
    this.isWord = true;
  }
  //  Otherwise:
  //  If current index is less than word length:
  if (index < word.length) {
    //  Get the current character
    const char = word[index];
    //  Get the next node in the trie
    //  or create a new one as needed
    const nextNode = this.characters[char] || new Trie();
    //  Make a recursive call on the next node
    nextNode.addWord(word, index + 1);
    //  Add a pointer to the next node as needed
    this.characters[char] = nextNode;
  }

  //  Optionally return the trie itself for easy chaining
  return this;
}
```

### Find Word

**Example:**

- `t.findWord("fate") // should return the node for the word "fate"`

```js
findWord(word, index = 0) {
  //  If current index is equal to word length:
  if (index === word.length) {
    //  Return the current node if it is a word
    return this;
  }

  //  Otherwise:
  //  Get the next character
  const nextChar = word[index];
  //  If no pointer to the next character exists
  //  in the current node, return undefined
  if (!this.characters[nextChar]) {
    return;
  }

  //  Otherwise, continue searching in the next node
  return this.characters[nextChar].findWord(word, index + 1);
}
```

### Get All Words

The `getWords()` method simply returns an array of all the words in the trie. It can also be extended to accept a starting/root node, and a prefix string to add before the words to be inserted in the resulting array.

**Example:**

- `t.getWords() // should return ["fun", "fast", "fat", "fate", "father", "forget", "awesome", "argue"]`

```js
getWords(root = this, prefix = "") {
  //  Create an array to store the results
  const res = [];

  //  Create a recursive helper function to help traverse the tree
  function traverse(currentNode, currentWord = "") {
    //  If current node is a word, add it to the array
    if (currentNode.isWord) {
      res.push(currentWord);
    }

    //  Loop over the characters in the current node
    for (let nextChar in currentNode.characters) {
      //  Get the next word based on the next character
      const nextWord = currentWord + nextChar;
      //  and make a recursive call on each of them
      traverse(currentNode.characters[nextChar], nextWord);
    }
  }

  //  Invoke the recursive helper function
  traverse(root, prefix);

  //  Return the results array
  return res;
}
```

### Autocomplete

The `autoComplete()` method accepts a string and returns an array of all the possible options in the trie for the string.

**Example:**

- `t.autoComplete("fa") // should return ["fast", "fat", "fate", "father"]`

```js
autoComplete(prefix) {
  //  Traverse the trie according to the given prefix
  const currentNode = this.findWord(prefix);
  //  Return all words coming from the current node, if any
  return currentNode ? this.getWords(currentNode, prefix) : [];
}
```

### Remove Word

The `removeWord()` method accepts a string and removes the word from the trie. Additionally, this method should also removes any parent nodes that may be left completely empty after removing the word from the trie.

**Example:**

- `t.removeWord("fat") // should remove "fat" from words list`
- `t.removeWord("argue") // should remove "argue" from words list`

```js
removeWord(word, index = 0) {
  //  If current index is equal to word length:
  if (index === word.length) {
    //  Unset the current node from being a word
    this.isWord = false;
  }
  //  Otherwise:
  //  If current index is less than the word length:
  if (index < word.length) {
    //  Get the current character
    const char = word[index];
    //  Get the next node in the trie
    const nextNode = this.characters[char];
    //  Make a recursive call if next node exists
    if (nextNode) {
      nextNode.removeWord(word, index + 1);
    }
  }

  //  Loop over children nodes, if any
  for (let key in this.characters) {
    const nextNode = this.characters[key];
    //  If next node is not a word and has no children:
    if (!nextNode.isWord && !Object.keys(nextNode.characters).length) {
      //  Delete the next node
      delete this.characters[key];
    }
  }
}
```
