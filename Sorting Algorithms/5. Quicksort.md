# Quicksort

Quicksort is a commonly used sorting algorithm developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959 and published in 1961. It is a Divide and Conquer algorithm that picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways:

1. Always pick first element as pivot. (implemented below)
2. Pick median as pivot. (ideal)
3. Always pick last element as pivot.
4. Pick a random element as pivot.

Quicksort partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. For this reason, it is sometimes called *partition-exchange sort*. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting.

Quicksort is a comparison sort, meaning that it can sort items of any type for which a "less-than" relation (formally, a total order) is defined. Efficient implementations of Quicksort are not a stable sort, meaning that the relative order of equal sort items is not preserved.

> **<ins>Time and Space Complexity</ins>**
> * The time complexity of Quicksort can be expressed as the recurrence relation *T(n) = T(k) + T(n-k-1) + θ(n)*, where *k* represents the number of elements smaller than the pivot element, *T(k)* and *T(n-k-1)* represent the two recursive calls, and ** represents the partition process.
> * In the worst case, the most unbalanced partition occurs when one of the sublists returned by the partitioning routine is of size n − 1. This may occur if the pivot happens to be the smallest (or largest) element in the list, or in some implementations, when all the elements are equal. The above recurrence relation can then be simplified in this case as *T(n-1) + θ(n)*, which can be solved into **θ(n<sup>2</sup>)**.
> * In the best case, the partition process always picks the middle element as pivot. Thus for each partition we divide the list into two nearly equal pieces. This means each recursive call processes a list of half the size, which means we only need to make *logn* calls before we reach a list of size 1. The above recurrence relation can then be simplified into *T(n) = 2T(n/2) + θ(n)*, which can be solved into **θ(n * logn)**.
> * In the average case where we sort an array of *n* distinct elements, quicksort takes **O(n * logn)** time in expectation, averaged over all *n!* permutations of *n* elements with equal probability.
> * Quicksort qualifies as an in-place sorting algorithm as it uses extra space only for storing recursive function calls but not for manipulating the input, meaning its space complexity can be expressed as **O(1)** for the array partitions. However, the recursive calls for Quicksort each add to the call stack, requiring at most **O(logn)** space.

### Exercise
1. Write a helper function called `pivot` that accepts an aray, a start index (defaults to 0) and an end index (defaults to the length of the input array - 1). The function should rearrange the elements in the array so that all values less than the pivot element aremoved to the left of the pivot, and all values greater than the pivot are moved to the right of the pivot. Take note of the following:
    * The order of the other elements on either side of the pivot doesn't matter.
    * The rearranging of the elements should be done **in-place** - that is, the function should not create a new array.
    * The function should return the sorted index of the pivot element.
2. Write a function called `quickSort` that takes an array of numbers, and returns the sorted array with all the numbers sorted from smallest to largest. Additionally, you should be able to see how the `pivot` helper function works on sorting the input array.

Examples:
* Pivot Helper

  `pivot([9,0,7,3,4,6,8,2,1,5]) // 9`

* Random

  `quickSort([9,0,7,3,4,6,8,2,1,5]) // [0,1,2,3,4,5,5,6,7,8,9]`

* Nearly Sorted

  `quickSort([8,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]) // [1,2,3,4,5,5,6,7,8]`

* Reversed

  `quickSort([9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]) // [1,2,3,4,5,5,6,7,8,9]`

* Few Unique

  `quickSort([4,5,2,4,5,1,3,5,4,5,3,5,3,2,4]) // [1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5]`
> **Note:** You should also see the status of the array after each pass in the console!

## Solution

### Pivot Helper Funcrion
```js
function pivot(arr, startIdx = 0, endIdx = arr.length - 1) {
  //  Grab pivot element from the array
  //! In this particular implementation, we're getting the pivot
  //! from the starting index, but other implementations can select
  //! any other (random) pivot element between start/end indices!
  const pivot = arr[startIdx];
  //  Initialize variable for current pivot index
  //! Interestingly, this also tracks how many
  //! elements are smaller that our pivot!
  let pivotIdx = startIdx;
  //  Loop over array from the given start to end indices
  for(let i = startIdx + 1; i <= endIdx; i++) {
    //  If current element is smaller than pivot:
    if(arr[i] < pivot) {
      //  Increment the pivot index variable,
      pivotIdx++;
      //  and swap the current element with
      //  the element at current pivot index
      [arr[i], arr[pivotIdx]] = [arr[pivotIdx], arr[i]];
    }
  }
  //  Swap pivot element (i.e. the starting element)
  //  with the element at the current pivot index
  [arr[startIdx], arr[pivotIdx]] = [arr[pivotIdx], arr[startIdx]];
  //  Return the pivot index
  return pivotIdx;
}
```

### Quick Sort
```js
function quickSort(arr, startIdx = 0, endIdx = arr.length - 1) {
  //  If subarray has more than two elements:
  if(startIdx < endIdx) {
    //  Get pivot index by calling the pivot helper on the subarray
    const pivotIdx = pivot(arr, startIdx, endIdx);
    //  Use pivot index to make recursive calls
    //  to the left and right of the pivot index
    //! Since the element at pivot index should already be sorted,
    //! we don't need to include it in the recursive calls!
    quickSort(arr, startIdx, pivotIdx - 1);
    quickSort(arr, pivotIdx + 1, endIdx);
  }
  //  Return the sorted array
  return arr;
}
```
