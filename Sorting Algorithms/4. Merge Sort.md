# Merge Sort

**Merge sort** is a *divide and conquer* algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945. It takes advantage of the fact that arrays of size 1 or 0 are always sorted.

Merge Sort divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves until the array is divided into subarrays of size 1 or 0, and then merges the two sorted halves until one full sorted array remains. A `merge()` helper function is useful for repeatedly merging the split subarrays.

*A recursive merge sort algorithm used to sort an array of 7 integer values. These are the steps a human would take to emulate merge sort (top-down).*

> **<ins>Time and Space Complexity</ins>**
> * Merge Sort is a recursive algorithm. Its time complexity can be expressed as the recurrence relation *T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n* ((apply the algorithm to two lists of half the size of the original list, and add the n steps taken to merge the resulting two lists)).
> * The time complexity of Merge Sort is Î¸(nLogn) in worst, average, and best cases as Merge Sort always divides the array into two halves and takes linear time to merge two halves.
> * Merge Sort has an auxillary space complexity of O(n), as it needs to create a temporary, separate array to store the split and merged halves. However, when sorting other data structures such as linked lists, Merge Sort can rearrange the list items while only needing O(1) auxillary space instead.

### Exercise
1. Write a function called `merge` that accepts two sorted arrays, and returns one merged array containing the items from both of the input arrays. The output array must also be sorted.
2. Write a function called `mergeSort` that takes an array of numbers, and returns the sorted array with all the numbers sorted from smallest to largest. Additionally, you should be able to see how the array elements gets split off and "merged" into their proper position for each pass.

Examples:
* Merge Helper

  `merge([1,3,5,7],[2,4,6,8]) // [1,2,3,4,5,5,6,7,8]`

* Random

  `mergeSort([9,0,7,3,4,6,8,2,1,5]) // [0,1,2,3,4,5,5,6,7,8,9]`

* Nearly Sorted

  `mergeSort([8,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]) // [1,2,3,4,5,5,6,7,8]`

* Reversed

  `mergeSort([9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]) // [1,2,3,4,5,5,6,7,8,9]`

* Few Unique

  `mergeSort([4,5,2,4,5,1,3,5,4,5,3,5,3,2,4]) // [1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5]`
> **Note:** You should also see the status of the array after each pass in the console!

## Solution

### Merge Helper Funcrion
```js
function merge(arr1, arr2) {
  //  Initialize a new empty array
  const newArr = [];
  //  Initialize two pointers, one for each input array
  let i = 0;
  let j = 0;
  //  Loop while both of the arrays are not empty
  while(i < arr1.length && j < arr2.length) {
    //  Compare the current values on both arrays,
    //  then add the smaller one to the new array
    if(arr1[i] < arr2[j]) {
      newArr.push(arr1[i]);
      i++;
    } else {
      newArr.push(arr2[j]);
      j++;
    }
  }
  //  Once we finish looping through either one of the arrays,
  //  add the remaining elements of the other array to the new array
  while(i < arr1.length) {
    newArr.push(arr1[i]);
    i++;
  }
  while(j < arr2.length) {
    newArr.push(arr2[j]);
    j++;
  }
  //  Return merged array
  return newArr;
}
```

### Merge Sort
```js
function mergeSort(arr) {
  //  If there's 1 element or less in the input array,
  //  simply return the input array
  if(arr.length <= 1) return arr;
  //  Otherwise:
  //  Split the input array in half,
  //  and call mergeSort on both halves
  const mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);
  const left = mergeSort(arr.slice(0, mid));
  const right = mergeSort(arr.slice(mid));
  //  Merge both halves of the input array,
  //  and return the merged array which is now also sorted
  return merge(left, right);
}
```
