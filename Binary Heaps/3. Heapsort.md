# Heapsort

Heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. Heapsort can be thought of as an improved selection sort: like selection sort, heapsort divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element from it and inserting it into the sorted region. Unlike selection sort, heapsort does not waste time with a linear-time scan of the unsorted region; rather, heap sort maintains the unsorted region in a heap data structure to more quickly find the largest element in each step.

The Heapsort algorithm involves preparing the list by first turning it into a max heap. The algorithm then repeatedly swaps the first value of the list with the last value, decreasing the range of values considered in the heap operation by one, and sifting the new first value into its position in the heap. This repeats until the range of considered values is one value in length.

The steps are:

1. Build a heap from the list. This can be done using a `heapify()` helper function to sift the largest values to the top of the heap. The `heapify()` function is called starting from the last non-leaf node going to the beginning of the list.
2. Swap the first element of the list with the final element. Decrease the considered range of the list by one.
3. Call the `heapify()` function on the list to sift the new first element to its appropriate index in the heap.
4. Go to step (2) unless the considered range of the list is one element.

> **<ins>Time Complexity</ins>**

> - The `heapify()` helper function takes **O(log n)** time to sift up the affected nodes, and is called within a loop that takes **O(n)** iterations. This means the Heapsort algorithm has a time complexity of **O(n log n)**.
> - Although somewhat slower in practice on most machines than a well-implemented quicksort, it has the advantage of a more favorable worst-case **O(n log n)** runtime. Heapsort is an in-place algorithm, but it is not a stable sort.

### Exercise

Write a function called `heapSort` that takes an array of numbers, and returns the sorted array with all the numbers sorted from smallest to largest. Additionally, you should be able to see how a max-heap is used for sorting the array.

Examples:

- Random

  `heapSort([9,0,7,3,4,6,8,2,1,5]) // [0,1,2,3,4,5,5,6,7,8,9]`

- Nearly Sorted

  `heapSort([8,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]) // [1,2,3,4,5,5,6,7,8]`

- Reversed

  `heapSort([9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]) // [1,2,3,4,5,5,6,7,8,9]`

- Few Unique

  `heapSort([4,5,2,4,5,1,3,5,4,5,3,5,3,2,4]) // [1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5]`

  > **Note:** You should also see the status of the array after each pass in the console!

### Solution

```js
function heapSort(arr) {
  //* Heapify input array
  //  Heapify sub-heaps, starting from last non-leaf node
  //? Last non-leaf node is Math.floor(arr.length/2) - 1
  for (let i = Math.floor(arr.length / 2) - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    heapify(arr, arr.length, i);
  }

  //* Now that we have our first max heap...
  //  Loop over the heap, starting from the end:
  for (let i = arr.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    //  Move the largest (root node) to the end of the heap
    [arr[0], arr[i]] = [arr[i], arr[0]];
    //  Heapify the reduced heap
    heapify(arr, i);
  }

  //  Return sorted array
  return arr;
}

function heapify(arr, size, current = 0) {
  //  Get children of current node
  const child1 = 2 * current + 1;
  const child2 = 2 * current + 2;

  //  Create a variable to keep track of largest node
  let largest = current;

  //  If current largest node is less than the left node:
  if (child1 < size && arr[child1] > arr[largest]) {
    //  Set new largest node to be the left node
    largest = child1;
  }

  //  If current largest node is less than the right node:
  if (child2 < size && arr[child2] > arr[largest]) {
    //  Set new largest node to be the right node
    largest = child2;
  }

  //  If current node is not the largest node:
  if (current !== largest) {
    //  Swap current and largest nodes
    [arr[current], arr[largest]] = [arr[largest], arr[current]];
    //  Heapify the affected sub-heap
    heapify(arr, size, largest);
  }
}
```
